  abstract = {The Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) was developed for NASA's Apollo program so astronauts could cover a greater range on the lunar surface, carry more science instruments, and return more soil and rock samples than by foot. Because of the unique lunar environment, the creation of flexible wheels was the most challenging and time consuming aspect of the LRV development. Wheels developed for previous lunar systems were not sufficient for use with this manned vehicle; therefore, several new designs were created and tested. Based on criteria set by NASA, the choices were narrowed down to two: the wire mesh wheel developed by General Motors, and the hoop spring wheel developed by the Bendix Corporation. Each of these underwent intensive mechanical, material, and terramechanical analyses, and in the end, the wire mesh wheel was chosen for the LRV. Though the wire mesh wheel was determined to be the best choice for its particular application, it may be insufficient towards achieving the objectives of future lunar missions that could require higher tractive capability, increased weight capacity, or extended life. Therefore lessons learned from the original LRV wheel development and suggestions for future Moon wheel projects are offered.}

  abstract  = {China's first Mars rover, Zhurong, has successfully touched down on the southern Utopia Planitia of Mars at 109.925 E, 25.066 N, and since performed cooperative multiscale investigations with the Tianwen-1 orbiter. Here we present primary localization and surface characterization results based on complementary data of the first 60 sols. The Zhurong rover has traversed 450.9 m southwards over a flat surface with mild wheel slippage (less than 0.2 in slip ratio). The encountered crescent-shaped sand dune indicates a NE-SW local wind direction, consistent with larger-range remote-sensing observations. Soil parameter analysis based on terramechanics indicates that the topsoil has high bearing strength and cohesion, and its equivalent stiffness and internal friction angle are ~1390-5872 kPa∙m-n and ~21°-34° respectively. Rocks observed strewn with dense pits, or showing layered and flaky structures, are presumed to be involved in physical weathering like severe wind erosion and potential chemical weathering processes. These preliminary observations suggest great potential of in-situ investigations by the scientific payload suite of the Zhurong rover in obtaining new clues of the region's aeolian and aqueous history. Cooperative investigations using the related payloads on both the rover and the obiter could peek into the habitability evolution of the northern lowlands on Mars.},

  abstract = {The lunar nearside has been investigated by many uncrewed and crewed missions, but the farside of the Moon remains poorly known. Lunar farside exploration is challenging because maneuvering rovers with efficient locomotion in harsh extraterrestrial environment is necessary to explore geological characteristics of scientific interest. Chang'E-4 mission successfully targeted the Moon's farside and deployed a teleoperated rover (Yutu-2) to explore inside the Von Kármán crater, conveying rich information regarding regolith, craters, and rocks. Here, we report mobile exploration on the lunar farside with Yutu-2 over the initial 2 years. During its journey, Yutu-2 has experienced varying degrees of mild slip and skid, indicating that the terrain is relatively flat at large scales but scattered with local gentle slopes. Cloddy soil sticking on its wheels implies a greater cohesion of the lunar soil than encountered at other lunar landing sites. Further identification results indicate that the regolith resembles dry sand and sandy loam on Earth in bearing properties, demonstrating greater bearing strength than that identified during the Apollo missions. In sharp contrast to the sparsity of rocks along the traverse route, small fresh craters with unilateral moldable ejecta are abundant, and some of them contain high-reflectance materials at the bottom, suggestive of secondary impact events. These findings hint at notable differences in the surface geology between the lunar farside and nearside. Experience gained with Yutu-2 improves the understanding of the farside of the Moon, which, in return, may lead to locomotion with improved efficiency and larger range. Yutu-2 conducted in situ exploration on the lunar farside, yielding insights into lunar regolith, craters, and rocks.}

  abstract = {We have identified and characterized a basaltic Mars simulant that is available as whole rocks, sand and dust. The source rock for the simulant is a basalt mined from the Tertiary Tropico Group in the western Mojave Desert. The Mojave Mars Simulant (MMS) was chosen for its inert hygroscopic characteristics, its availability in a variety of forms, and its physical and chemical characteristics. The MMS dust and MMS sand are produced by mechanically crushing basaltic boulders. This is a process that more closely resembles the weathering/comminution processes on Mars where impact events and aerodynamic interactions provide comminution in the (relative) absence of water and organics. MMS is among the suite of test rocks and soils that was used in the development of the 2007/8 Phoenix Scout and is being used in the 2009 Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) missions. The MMS development team is using the simulant for research that centers on sampling tool interactions in icy soils. Herein we describe the physical properties and chemical composition of this new Mars simulant.}

  abstract = {In the landslide-prone area near the Nice international airport, southeastern France, an interdisciplinary approach is applied to develop realistic lithological/geometrical profiles and geotechnical/strength sub-seafloor models. Such models are indispensable for slope stability assessments using limit equilibrium or finite element methods. Regression analyses, based on the undrained shear strength (su) of intact gassy sediments are used to generate a sub-seafloor strength model based on 37 short dynamic and eight long static piezocone penetration tests, and laboratory experiments on one Calypso piston and 10 gravity cores. Significant strength variations were detected when comparing measurements from the shelf and the shelf break, with a significant drop in su to 5.5kPa being interpreted as a weak zone at a depth between 6.5 and 8.5m below seafloor (mbsf). Here, a 10% reduction of the in situ total unit weight compared to the surrounding sediments is found to coincide with coarse-grained layers that turn into a weak zone and detachment plane for former and present-day gravitational, retrogressive slide events, as seen in 2D chirp profiles. The combination of high-resolution chirp profiles and comprehensive geotechnical information allows us to compute enhanced 2D finite element slope stability analysis with undrained sediment response compared to previous 2D numerical and 3D limit equilibrium assessments. Those models suggest that significant portions (detachment planes at 20m or even 55mbsf) of the Quaternary delta and slope apron deposits may be mobilized. Given that factors of safety are equal or less than 1 when further considering the effect of free gas, a high risk for a landslide event of considerable size off Nice international airport is identified.}

  abstract = {In recent decades, extensive effort has been devoted to simulating the tractive performance of an off-road tire on granular terrain using the combined discrete element and finite element (DE-FE) method. Previous works normally idealized irregular gravel materials using spherical DEs, requiring an artificial rolling resistance moment to deal with the interlocking mechanism between irregular granular particles. In this work, we propose a multi-sphere DE-FE method to address this issue. The main appeal is that our presented method can describe the irregular shapes of gravel materials more accurately, and simulates the interactions between non-spherical granular particles and the tire in a natural way. As a result, the artificial rolling resistance moment is not required in our presented method. Three kinds of multi-sphere gravel particle models are established, and the effectiveness of our proposed method is validated via a piling test. Then we calibrate the simulation parameters of tire-terrain interactions using triaxial tests. Finally, the generation method of the multi-sphere gravel terrain is presented, and the tractive performance of an off-road pneumatic tire on irregular gravel terrain is simulated. Our simulation results are found to be in good agreement with experimental data. Numerical results also show that our presented method can better reproduce the traveling behavior of the tire than the widely used spherical DE-FE method in terms of the tractive force and rim sinkage histories.}
