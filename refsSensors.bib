Generating precise simulations and understanding very large data are problems in scientific visualization, whereas convincing simulations and realistic visuals are challenges in motion pictures. Both require volumes with dynamic topology, very large domains, and efficient high quality rendering. We present the GPU voxel database structure, GVDB, based on the voxel database topology of Museth [Mus13], as a method for efficient GPU-based compute and raytracing on a sparse hierarchy of grids. GVDB introduces an indexed memory pooling design for dynamic topology, and a novel hierarchical traversal for efficient raytracing on the GPU. Examples are provided for ray sampling of volumetric data, rendering of isosurfaces with multiple scattering, and raytracing of level sets. We demonstrate that GVDB can give large performance improvements over CPU methods with identical quality.},

The model surface on which the derivation is based consists of a semi-infinite, porous layer of randomly placed obscuring objects suspended in depth in such a way that the interstices separating them are interconnected. A layer of fine, loosely compacted dust is in the category of surfaces described by this model, but volcanic foam is not. The shape of the photometric curve depends on the fractional void volume. Bulk densities of the order of one-tenth that of solid rock are implied for the upper layers of the surface of the moon.},

  abstract = {AbstractWe derived spatially resolved near-global Hapke photometric parameter maps of the Moon from 21 months of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Wide Angle Camera (WAC) multispectral observations using a novel “tile-by-tile method” (1° latitude by 1° longitude bins). The derived six parameters (w,b,c,BS0,hS, and) for each tile were used to normalize the observed reflectance (standard angles i = g = 60°, e = 0° instead of the traditional angles i = g = 30°, e = 0°) within each tile, resulting in accurate normalization optimized for the local photometric response. Each pixel in the seven-color near-global mosaic (70°S to 70°N and 0°E to 360°E) was computed by the median of normalized reflectance from large numbers of repeated observations (UV: ∼50 and visible: ∼126 on average). The derived mosaic exhibits no significant artifacts with latitude or along the tile boundaries, demonstrating the quality of the normalization procedure. The derived Hapke parameter maps reveal regional photometric response variations across the lunar surface. The b, c (Henyey-Greenstein double-lobed phase function parameters) maps demonstrate decreased backscattering in the maria relative to the highlands (except 321 nm band), probably due to the higher content of both SMFe (submicron iron) and ilmenite in the interiors of back scattering agglutinates in the maria. The hS (angular width of shadow hiding opposition effect) map exhibits relatively lower values in the maria than the highlands and slightly higher values for immature highland crater ejecta, possibly related to the variation in a grain size distribution of regolith.},

  abstract       = {With the significant advancement of sensor and communication technology and the reliable application of obstacle detection techniques and algorithms, automated driving is becoming a pivotal technology that can revolutionize the future of transportation and mobility. Sensors are fundamental to the perception of vehicle surroundings in an automated driving system, and the use and performance of multiple integrated sensors can directly determine the safety and feasibility of automated driving vehicles. Sensor calibration is the foundation block of any autonomous system and its constituent sensors and must be performed correctly before sensor fusion and obstacle detection processes may be implemented. This paper evaluates the capabilities and the technical performance of sensors which are commonly employed in autonomous vehicles, primarily focusing on a large selection of vision cameras, LiDAR sensors, and radar sensors and the various conditions in which such sensors may operate in practice. We present an overview of the three primary categories of sensor calibration and review existing open-source calibration packages for multi-sensor calibration and their compatibility with numerous commercial sensors. We also summarize the three main approaches to sensor fusion and review current state-of-the-art multi-sensor fusion techniques and algorithms for object detection in autonomous driving applications. The current paper, therefore, provides an end-to-end review of the hardware and software methods required for sensor fusion object detection. We conclude by highlighting some of the challenges in the sensor fusion field and propose possible future research directions for automated driving systems.},

As indicated by its name, NanoVDB is a mini-version of the much bigger OpenVDB library, both in terms of functionality and scope. However, NanoVDB offers one major advantage over OpenVDB, namely support for GPUs. As such it is applicable to both CPU and GPU accelerated simulation and rendering of high-resolution sparse volumes. In fact, it has already been adopted for real-time applications by several commercial renders and digital content creation tools, e.g. Autodesk’s Arnold, Blender, SideFX’s Houdini, and NVIDIA’s Omniverse just to mention a few.},

abstract = {This document might be out of date, please check online for an updated version.With significant advances in techniques, along with increasing computational power, path tracing has now become the predominant rendering method used in movie production. Thanks to these advances, volume rendering can now take full advantage of the path tracing revolution, allowing the creation of photoreal images that would not have been feasible only a few years ago. However, volume rendering also provides its own set of unique challenges that can be daunting to path tracer developers and researchers accustomed to dealing only with surfaces. While recent texts and materials have covered some of these challenges, to the best of our knowledge none have comprehensively done so, especially when confronted with the complexity and scale demands required by production. For example, the last volume rendering course at SIGGRAPH in 2011 discussed ray marching and precomputed lighting and shadowing, none of which are techniques advisable for production purposes in 2017.},
