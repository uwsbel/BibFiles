  Abstract                 = {Nowadays the theory of multi-body systems including unilateral constraints is quite well established. However, the tendency towards more and more detailed and complex models may not be compensated with increasing computer power. In fact the growing computational effort demands for improved numerical methods in order to solve large systems. In this paper a time-stepping method is proposed for the computation of multi-body systems with many unilateral constraints. Stability and accuracy are discussed with respect to the given discretisation. In order to handle many contacts an iterative algorithm is applied based on a Gauss-Seidel relaxation scheme. A numerical example shows the efficiency of the relaxation scheme in comparison with Lemke's method and an Augmented Lagrangian approach.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper outlines a novel approach to the modeling and analysis of impact involving multibody systems. This approach is based on an analysis of energy absorption and restitution during impact, using a decomposition of the kinetic energy, which decouples the parts associated with the spaces of admissible and constrained motions of the underlying unilateral constraints. Such a decomposition turns out to be useful in the analysis of energy dissipation during impact, and leads to a generalized definition of the energetic coefficient of restitution, which targets particularly collisions in multibody systems. The applicability of the approach reported is investigated by conducting an experimental study on a robotic testbed. It is shown that impact between multibody systems is considerably affected not only by the local dynamics characteristics of the interacting bodies, but also the configuration of the whole multibody system. The results reported here show that our decomposition can offer a sound characterization of impact in several problems of multibody systems.},
