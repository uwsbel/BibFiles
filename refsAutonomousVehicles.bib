        abstract = {SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) is a microscopic traffic simulator. It has been developed by the German Aerospace Center since 2003 and published as Open Source (see http://sumo.dlr.de). In this talk, SUMO and its capabilities for the realistic simulation of cars, busses, bikes, pedestrians, trains and even ships in cities, such as Berlin, are presented in an overview. A short and hands-on tutorial for the live creation of a simulation scenario is provided. This scenario is a starting point to shed a light on the various application areas of SUMO, such as simulating and testing autonomous vehicles, traffic modeling, traffic light optimization, intermodal trip planning, ... Each application area is illustrated with concrete project references in which SUMO was successfully applied. Finally, the power and the advantages of coupling SUMO with other simulators to simulate car-to-car communication or virtual testing with Car Maker is presented. In January 2017, the German Aerospace Center joined the Eclipse Foundation and plans to make this simulator available under EPL. This is part of a joint initiative between German Aerospace Center, Fraunhofer FOKUS, University of Paderborn and IPG Automotive to create a "Collaborative Working Group" within the Eclipse Foundation to coordinate the development of the first Open Simulation Platform for Autonomous Mobility. We believe that understanding the effects of autonomous mobility and having an open test platform for autonomous vehicles are both essential to solve the urgent problems in traffic in the next years.}

% - 2012 - library is still somewhat maintained - open source
% - Focused on simulating swarms of robots
% - Allows for using different physics engines for different portions of the simulation space
% - Most benchmark tests use a 2D engine, but they do have support for ODE and do some tests with it running 3D simulations
% - Runs much faster than real-time for up to 10^4 or 10^5 robots
% - Uses threads/OpenMP to achieve performance gains
% - State (without evidence?) that Webots, USARSim and Gazebo are slower than real time for more than a few dozen robots

% - 2017 - Use Intel Vtune Amplifier
% - Determine simulation time increases quadratically in a swarm scenario, and linearly in a "high complexity" environment
% - Also uses RTF the other way than we do
% - Analyze a swarm scenario
% - Talk a lot about specific function calls which doesn't seem relevant or helpful
% - ParaGazebo - which uses an "island thread" model - disjoint regions of space are simulated on different threads - to improve parallelism. High overhead in spawning these threads
% - Doesn't draw any strong conclusions from their case study, really just state what they found with no investigation of the "why" or "so what"

% - 2017 - comparison between MORSE and Gazebo
% - Defines Real-time factor the other way around
% - MORSE and Gazebo reach 5x real-time around 6 robots … running on a Thinkpad laptop
% - They talk about some weird GPU/CPU trade-off but don't explain how the two platforms use GPU in their computations, is is just for rendering?

% - 2019, still in pre-print. Open-source
% - Library for soft-body robotics that uses CUDA
% - Spring-mass damper system for the forces and displacements of the bodies
% - Capable of simulating 100s of "robots" in parallel, doesn't seem to have much more than soft-body
% - Memory management system on the GPU allows for adding and removing supports as the simulation is running (topology optimization)
% - Has a decent amount of detail on the internals of the physics system

% - Details 2.5D simulation methodology for achieving linear scaling
% - Focuses on ray-tracing and collision detection
% - Goal is to be "realistic enough" for many applications of interest
% - Simulations many common components with some detail rather than any component at a high level of detail
