% - 2012 - library is still somewhat maintained - open source
% - Focused on simulating swarms of robots
% - Allows for using different physics engines for different portions of the simulation space
% - Most benchmark tests use a 2D engine, but they do have support for ODE and do some tests with it running 3D simulations
% - Runs much faster than real-time for up to 10^4 or 10^5 robots
% - Uses threads/OpenMP to achieve performance gains
% - State (without evidence?) that Webots, USARSim and Gazebo are slower than real time for more than a few dozen robots

% - 2017 - Use Intel Vtune Amplifier
% - Determine simulation time increases quadratically in a swarm scenario, and linearly in a "high complexity" environment
% - Also uses RTF the other way than we do
% - Analyze a swarm scenario
% - Talk a lot about specific function calls which doesn't seem relevant or helpful
% - ParaGazebo - which uses an "island thread" model - disjoint regions of space are simulated on different threads - to improve parallelism. High overhead in spawning these threads
% - Doesn't draw any strong conclusions from their case study, really just state what they found with no investigation of the "why" or "so what"

% - 2017 - comparison between MORSE and Gazebo
% - Defines Real-time factor the other way around
% - MORSE and Gazebo reach 5x real-time around 6 robots … running on a Thinkpad laptop
% - They talk about some weird GPU/CPU trade-off but don't explain how the two platforms use GPU in their computations, is is just for rendering?

% - 2019, still in pre-print. Open-source
% - Library for soft-body robotics that uses CUDA
% - Spring-mass damper system for the forces and displacements of the bodies
% - Capable of simulating 100s of "robots" in parallel, doesn't seem to have much more than soft-body
% - Memory management system on the GPU allows for adding and removing supports as the simulation is running (topology optimization)
% - Has a decent amount of detail on the internals of the physics system

% - Details 2.5D simulation methodology for achieving linear scaling
% - Focuses on ray-tracing and collision detection
% - Goal is to be "realistic enough" for many applications of interest
% - Simulations many common components with some detail rather than any component at a high level of detail
