        abstract = {SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) is a microscopic traffic simulator. It has been developed by the German Aerospace Center since 2003 and published as Open Source (see http://sumo.dlr.de). In this talk, SUMO and its capabilities for the realistic simulation of cars, busses, bikes, pedestrians, trains and even ships in cities, such as Berlin, are presented in an overview. A short and hands-on tutorial for the live creation of a simulation scenario is provided. This scenario is a starting point to shed a light on the various application areas of SUMO, such as simulating and testing autonomous vehicles, traffic modeling, traffic light optimization, intermodal trip planning, ... Each application area is illustrated with concrete project references in which SUMO was successfully applied. Finally, the power and the advantages of coupling SUMO with other simulators to simulate car-to-car communication or virtual testing with Car Maker is presented. In January 2017, the German Aerospace Center joined the Eclipse Foundation and plans to make this simulator available under EPL. This is part of a joint initiative between German Aerospace Center, Fraunhofer FOKUS, University of Paderborn and IPG Automotive to create a "Collaborative Working Group" within the Eclipse Foundation to coordinate the development of the first Open Simulation Platform for Autonomous Mobility. We believe that understanding the effects of autonomous mobility and having an open test platform for autonomous vehicles are both essential to solve the urgent problems in traffic in the next years.}

	abstract = {Traffic waves are phenomena that emerge when the vehicular density exceeds a critical threshold. Considering the presence of increasingly automated vehicles in the traffic stream, a number of research activities have focused on the influence of automated vehicles on the bulk traffic flow. In the present article, we demonstrate experimentally that intelligent control of an autonomous vehicle is able to dampen stop-and-go waves that can arise even in the absence of geometric or lane changing triggers. Precisely, our experiments on a circular track with more than 20 vehicles show that traffic waves emerge consistently, and that they can be dampened by controlling the velocity of a single vehicle in the flow. We compare metrics for velocity, braking events, and fuel economy across experiments. These experimental findings suggest a paradigm shift in traffic management: flow control will be possible via a few mobile actuators (less than 5%) long before a majority of vehicles have autonomous capabilities.}

ABSTRACT = {Intersections are considered one of the most complex scenarios in a self-driving framework due to the uncertainty in the behaviors of surrounding vehicles and the different types of scenarios that can be found. To deal with this problem, we provide a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach for intersection handling, which is combined with Curriculum Learning to improve the training process. The state space is defined by two vectors, containing adversaries and ego vehicle information. We define a features extractor module and an actor&ndash;critic approach combined with Curriculum Learning techniques, adding complexity to the environment by increasing the number of vehicles. In order to address a complete autonomous driving system, a hybrid architecture is proposed. The operative level generates the driving commands, the strategy level defines the trajectory and the tactical level executes the high-level decisions. This high-level decision system is the main goal of this research. To address realistic experiments, we set up three scenarios: intersections with traffic lights, intersections with traffic signs and uncontrolled intersections. The results of this paper show that a Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm can infer ego vehicle-desired behavior for different intersection scenarios based only on the behavior of adversarial vehicles.},

Due to implementation issues and missing infrastructure, the impact of connected and automated vehicles on the traffic flow can only be evaluated in accurate simulations. Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) provides necessary and appropriate models and tools. SUMO contains many car-following models that replicate automated driving, but cannot realistically imitate human driving behavior. When simulating queued vehicles driving off, existing car-following models are neither able to correctly emulate the acceleration behavior of human drivers nor the resulting vehicle gaps. Thus, we propose a time-discrete 2D Human Driver Model to replicate realistic trajectories. We start by combining previously published extensions of the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) to one generalized model. Discontinuities due to introduced reaction times, estimation errors and lane changes are conquered with new approaches and equations. Above all, the start-up procedure receives more attention than in existing papers. We also provide a first evaluation of the advanced car-following model using 30 minutes of an aerial measurement. This dataset contains three hours of drone recordings from two signalized intersections in Stuttgart, Germany. The method designed for extracting the vehicle trajectories from the raw video data is outlined. Furthermore, we evaluate the accuracy of the trajectories obtained by the aerial measurement using a specially equipped vehicle.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, journal={SUMO Conference Proceedings}, author={Salles, Dominik and Kaufmann, Stefan and Reuss, Hans-Christian}, year={2022}, month={Jul.}, pages={1–25} }
