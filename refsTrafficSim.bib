  abstract  = {SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) is a microscopic traffic simulator. It has been developed by the German Aerospace Center since 2003 and published as Open Source (see http://sumo.dlr.de). In this talk, SUMO and its capabilities for the realistic simulation of cars, busses, bikes, pedestrians, trains and even ships in cities, such as Berlin, are presented in an overview. A short and hands-on tutorial for the live creation of a simulation scenario is provided. This scenario is a starting point to shed a light on the various application areas of SUMO, such as simulating and testing autonomous vehicles, traffic modeling, traffic light optimization, intermodal trip planning, ... Each application area is illustrated with concrete project references in which SUMO was successfully applied. Finally, the power and the advantages of coupling SUMO with other simulators to simulate car-to-car communication or virtual testing with Car Maker is presented. In January 2017, the German Aerospace Center joined the Eclipse Foundation and plans to make this simulator available under EPL. This is part of a joint initiative between German Aerospace Center, Fraunhofer FOKUS, University of Paderborn and IPG Automotive to create a "Collaborative Working Group" within the Eclipse Foundation to coordinate the development of the first Open Simulation Platform for Autonomous Mobility. We believe that understanding the effects of autonomous mobility and having an open test platform for autonomous vehicles are both essential to solve the urgent problems in traffic in the next years.}

  abstract = {Traffic waves are phenomena that emerge when the vehicular density exceeds a critical threshold. Considering the presence of increasingly automated vehicles in the traffic stream, a number of research activities have focused on the influence of automated vehicles on the bulk traffic flow. In the present article, we demonstrate experimentally that intelligent control of an autonomous vehicle is able to dampen stop-and-go waves that can arise even in the absence of geometric or lane changing triggers. Precisely, our experiments on a circular track with more than 20 vehicles show that traffic waves emerge consistently, and that they can be dampened by controlling the velocity of a single vehicle in the flow. We compare metrics for velocity, braking events, and fuel economy across experiments. These experimental findings suggest a paradigm shift in traffic management: flow control will be possible via a few mobile actuators (less than 5%) long before a majority of vehicles have autonomous capabilities.}

  abstract       = {Intersections are considered one of the most complex scenarios in a self-driving framework due to the uncertainty in the behaviors of surrounding vehicles and the different types of scenarios that can be found. To deal with this problem, we provide a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach for intersection handling, which is combined with Curriculum Learning to improve the training process. The state space is defined by two vectors, containing adversaries and ego vehicle information. We define a features extractor module and an actor&ndash;critic approach combined with Curriculum Learning techniques, adding complexity to the environment by increasing the number of vehicles. In order to address a complete autonomous driving system, a hybrid architecture is proposed. The operative level generates the driving commands, the strategy level defines the trajectory and the tactical level executes the high-level decisions. This high-level decision system is the main goal of this research. To address realistic experiments, we set up three scenarios: intersections with traffic lights, intersections with traffic signs and uncontrolled intersections. The results of this paper show that a Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm can infer ego vehicle-desired behavior for different intersection scenarios based only on the behavior of adversarial vehicles.},

  abstractnote = {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Connected and automated driving functions are key components for future vehicles. Due to implementation issues and missing infrastructure, the impact of connected and automated vehicles on the traffic flow can only be evaluated in accurate simulations. Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) provides necessary and appropriate models and tools. SUMO contains many car-following models that replicate automated driving, but cannot realistically imitate human driving behavior. When simulating queued vehicles driving off, existing car-following models are neither able to correctly emulate the acceleration behavior of human drivers nor the resulting vehicle gaps. Thus, we propose a time-discrete 2D Human Driver Model to replicate realistic trajectories. We start by combining previously published extensions of the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) to one generalized model. Discontinuities due to introduced reaction times, estimation errors and lane changes are conquered with new approaches and equations. Above all, the start-up procedure receives more attention than in existing papers. We also provide a first evaluation of the advanced car-following model using 30 minutes of an aerial measurement. This dataset contains three hours of drone recordings from two signalized intersections in Stuttgart, Germany. The method designed for extracting the vehicle trajectories from the raw video data is outlined. Furthermore, we evaluate the accuracy of the trajectories obtained by the aerial measurement using a specially equipped vehicle.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

This research has been developed at an initial phase of the project to support the conception of a new driver assistance system aimed at improving longitudinal driving by means of information, warning and intervention strategies. In this research, the contribution to the system conception is based on providing a knowledge base of driver behaviour through the conduction of simulator experiments, so that driver modelling can be supported by driving performance data corresponding to specific scenarios of interest. In particular, this paper is aimed at investigating driver behaviour under different circumstances, namely, different longitudinal driving scenarios and distraction caused by a visual and a cognitive secondary task while driving. This way, visual and cognitive distraction effects on longitudinal driving can be analysed, focusing on the driving situations of interest. This paper provides a thorough description of the rationale behind the investigation and describes the methodology and procedure used for the experiments conduction. Moreover, the main results achieved through this research and how these results are linked to the modelling phase inside the ISi-PADAS project are covered within this paper.},

  abstractnote = {The continuous growth of road traffic volumes leads to significant environment and economical problems. For this reason there have been efforts for more than four decades to understand the dynamics of traffic flow in order to find ways to optimize traffic with respect to a reduction of environmental impacts and economical losses due to congestion. In this work a microscopic model to traffic flow is proposed that adds to the understanding of the different types of congestion that are found in traffic flow. The main assumption the model is based on is the fact that in general vehicles move without colliding. From this property of vehicle motion a model can be derived that shows a rich dynamics and proves to be in good agreement with empirical data. The model is mainly characterized by the parameters describing typical acceleration and deceleration capabilities of the vehicles. It closely resembles other well-known models for certain choices of these parameters. By varying acceleration and deceleration capabilities a thorough understanding of the dynamics of the model and the previously known special cases is gained. (orig.) [Deutsch] Das anhaltende Wachstum des Strassenverkehrsvolumens fuehrt in wirtschaftlicher und umweltpolitischer Hinsicht zu spuerbaren Problemen. Aus diesem Grund gibt es seit mehr als vier Jahrzehnten Bemuehungen, ein Verstaendnis fuer die Dynamik des Verkehrsflusses zu gewinnen, um hierauf aufbauend Wege zu einer Optimierung des Verkehrs im Hinblick auf die Reduktion von Umweltbelastungen und wirtschaftlichen Verlusten aufgrund von Ueberlastungserscheinungen zu finden. In dieser Arbeit wird ein mikroskopisches Modell des Verkehrsflusses entwickelt, das zu einem tieferen Verstaendnis der verschiedenen Ueberlastungszustaende im Strassenverkehr beitraegt. Die grundlegende Annahme, auf der das Modell beruht, besteht in der Tatsache, dass Fahrzeuge sich in der Regel kollisionsfrei bewegen. Aus dieser Eigenschft der Fahrzeugbewegung kann ein Modell abgeleitet werden, das eine reichhaltige Dynamik aufweist und sich in guter Uebereinstimmung mit empirischen Daten befindet. Das Modell wird hauptsaechlich durch die Parameter charakterisiert, die typische Beschleunigungs- und Verzoegerungsfaehigkeiten der Fahrzeuge beschreiben. Fuer spezielle Werte dieser Parameter wird das Modell anderen, bereits bekannten, Modellen sehr aehnlich. Indem Beschleunigungs- und Verzoegerungsfaehigkeiten variiert werden, laesst sich ein sehr gutes Verstaendnis fuer die Dynamik des Modells und seiner bereits fruehen bekannten Spezialfaelle erlangen.

  abstract = {The primary goal for driver assistance systems so far has been to increase driving safety and/or the driving comfort. The effects of these driver assistance systems on traffic flow are usually analyzed using traffic simulations. Research literature detailing the laying out of driver assistance systems to optimize traffic flow is less common. Assuming that traffic flow can also be locally optimized through individual driver assistance systems, this paper presents a new type of assistance system for traffic flow adaptive driving. Simulation investigations are necessary for the design, optimization and evaluation of these systems. Previous procedures used for simulation investigations are insufficient for the investigation of these new systems, since these systems have their own set of particular requirements for simulation. Based on the presented system, the requirements are represented by the detailed mapping of car-following behavior as well as the simultaneous consideration of microscopic and macroscopic system behavior.}

  abstract = {It has been widely reported in literature that a small perturbation in traffic flow such as a sudden deceleration of a vehicle could lead to the formation of traffic jams without a clear bottleneck. These traffic jams are usually related to instabilities in traffic flow. The applications of intelligent traffic systems are a potential solution to reduce the amplitude or to eliminate the formation of such traffic instabilities. A lot of research has been conducted to theoretically study the effect of intelligent vehicles, for example adaptive cruise control vehicles, using either computer simulation or analytical method. However, most current analytical research has only applied to single class traffic flow. To this end, the main topic of this paper is to perform a linear stability analysis to find the stability threshold of heterogeneous traffic flow using microscopic models, particularly the effect of intelligent vehicles on heterogeneous (or multi-class) traffic flow instabilities. The analytical results will show how intelligent vehicle percentages affect the stability of multi-class traffic flow.}
