        abstract = {SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) is a microscopic traffic simulator. It has been developed by the German Aerospace Center since 2003 and published as Open Source (see http://sumo.dlr.de). In this talk, SUMO and its capabilities for the realistic simulation of cars, busses, bikes, pedestrians, trains and even ships in cities, such as Berlin, are presented in an overview. A short and hands-on tutorial for the live creation of a simulation scenario is provided. This scenario is a starting point to shed a light on the various application areas of SUMO, such as simulating and testing autonomous vehicles, traffic modeling, traffic light optimization, intermodal trip planning, ... Each application area is illustrated with concrete project references in which SUMO was successfully applied. Finally, the power and the advantages of coupling SUMO with other simulators to simulate car-to-car communication or virtual testing with Car Maker is presented. In January 2017, the German Aerospace Center joined the Eclipse Foundation and plans to make this simulator available under EPL. This is part of a joint initiative between German Aerospace Center, Fraunhofer FOKUS, University of Paderborn and IPG Automotive to create a "Collaborative Working Group" within the Eclipse Foundation to coordinate the development of the first Open Simulation Platform for Autonomous Mobility. We believe that understanding the effects of autonomous mobility and having an open test platform for autonomous vehicles are both essential to solve the urgent problems in traffic in the next years.}

	abstract = {Traffic waves are phenomena that emerge when the vehicular density exceeds a critical threshold. Considering the presence of increasingly automated vehicles in the traffic stream, a number of research activities have focused on the influence of automated vehicles on the bulk traffic flow. In the present article, we demonstrate experimentally that intelligent control of an autonomous vehicle is able to dampen stop-and-go waves that can arise even in the absence of geometric or lane changing triggers. Precisely, our experiments on a circular track with more than 20 vehicles show that traffic waves emerge consistently, and that they can be dampened by controlling the velocity of a single vehicle in the flow. We compare metrics for velocity, braking events, and fuel economy across experiments. These experimental findings suggest a paradigm shift in traffic management: flow control will be possible via a few mobile actuators (less than 5%) long before a majority of vehicles have autonomous capabilities.}
