	abstract = {The finite-element formulation and integration algorithms developed in Part I are used to analyse a number of practical problems involving unsaturated and saturated soils. The formulation and algorithms perform well for all the cases analysed, with the robustness of the latter being largely insensitive to user-defined parameters such as the number of coarse time steps and error control tolerances. The efficiency of the algorithms, as measured by the CPU time consumed, does not depend on the number of coarse time steps, but may be influenced by the error control tolerances. Based on the analyses presented here, typical values for the error control tolerances are suggested. It is also shown that the constitutive modelling framework presented in Part I can, by adjusting one constitutive equation and one or two material parameters, be used to simulate soils that expand or collapse upon wetting. Treating the suction as a strain variable instead of a stress variable proves to be an efficient and robust way of solving suction-dependent plastic yielding. Moreover, the concept of the constitutive stress is a particularly convenient way of handling the transition between saturation and unsaturation. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a complete finite-element treatment for unsaturated soil problems. A new formulation of general constitutive equations for unsaturated soils is first presented. In the incremental stress–strain equations, the suction or the pore water pressure is treated as a strain variable instead of a stress variable. The global governing equations are derived in terms of displacement and pore water pressure. The discretized governing equations are then solved using an adaptive time-stepping scheme which automatically adjusts the time-step size so that the integration error in the displacements and pore pressures lies close to a specified tolerance. The non-linearity caused by suction-dependent plastic yielding, suction-dependent degree of saturation, and saturation-dependent permeability is treated in a similar way to the elastoplasticity. An explicit stress integration scheme is used to solve the constitutive stress–strain equations at the Gauss point level. The elastoplastic stiffness matrix in the Euler solution is evaluated using the suction as well as the stresses and hardening parameters at the start of the subincrement, while the elastoplastic matrix in the modified Euler solution is evaluated using the suction at the end of the subincrement. In addition, when applying subincrementation, the same rate is applied to all strain components including the suction. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This is due in part to the stress and contact heterogeneities inherent to these systems. Heat conduction in a packet bed of cylinders is investigated both experimentally and computationally. A novel model is developed based on the Discrete Element Method, which not only sheds light on fundamental issues in heat conduction in particles, but also provides a valuable test bed for existing theories. By explicitly modeling individual particles within the bulk material, bed heterogeneities are directly included, and dynamic temperature distributions are obtained at the particle level. Comparison with experiments shows that this model yields a quantitatively accurate temperature field without the need for adjustable parameters or detailed microstructural information. This simple system may also provide insight into such phenomena as reactor hot spot formation and spontaneous combustion of bulk reactive materials.},

A significant increase in the average force is observed for steel particles confined within a box with fixed walls at temperature rises of 50 °C and 100 °C, respectively. As previously noted in the literature, thermal expansion also induces compaction. The results show that a systematic and controllable increase in granular packing can be induced by simply raising and then lowering the temperature, without the input of mechanical energy in agreement with previous experimental observations. We find that the evolution of the packing fraction is well described by a fractional relaxation model, which follows the Mittag-Leffler law.},

The basic idea of this method is to construct the numerical base functions considering both the topology and the material properties of the particles within the granular system. Dividing the whole domain into a number of coarse elements, the base functions can be accounted from solving the boundary value problem on each element. The thermal conduction and the heat capacity matrices can then be obtained from the contributions of all the contact pairs corresponding to each coarse element. With the global thermal property matrices assembled, the transient thermal conduction problem can be solved using the same technique as the finite element method. Moreover, the temperature of every particle can be simultaneously obtained from the downscaling computation during the computation procedure. The numerical tests indicate that the developed method can be successfully used for solving the transient thermal conduction problem within the granular materials, which can reduce the computational efforts greatly.},

Thermal conduction is already available in DEM codes such as the particle flow code (PFC). However, current DEM codes rarely account for convective heat transport. There are many important phenomena in different applications that involve convective heat transport due to flow of fluid through permeable solid material, where the fluid and the permeable solids have different initial temperatures. Heat transfer from convection is dependent on the fluid flow velocity through existing and new instantaneously forming flow paths in solid and is typically much faster than conduction. The complete formulation of the heat convection model, its implementation and coupling with fluid flow and heat conduction in PFC2D, and its validation are described in detail. While DEM has been widely used for studying fundamental mechanisms in geomaterials, little effort has been devoted toward extending DEM for studying coupling between conductive heat flow and convective heat transport problems. The developments presented in this paper will enable application of DEM to study coupled hydro-thermo-mechanical processes in geomaterials such as in geothermal systems, hydrocarbon production, environmental engineering and nuclear waste storage.},

	abstract = {The Smooth-Particle-Hydrodynamics (SPH) method is derived in a novel manner by means of a Galerkin approximation applied to the Lagrangian equations of continuum mechanics as in the finite-element method. This derivation is modified to replace the SPH interpolant with the Moving-Least-Squares (MLS) interpolant of Lancaster and Saulkaskas, and define a new particle volume which ensures thermodynamic compatibility. A variable-rank modification of the MLS interpolants which retains their desirable summation properties is introduced to remove the singularities that occur when divergent flow reduces the number of neighbours of a particle to less than the minimum required. A surprise benefit of the Galerkin SPH derivation is a theoretical justification of a common ad hoc technique for variable-h SPH. The new MLSPH method is conservative if an anti-symmetric quadrature rule for the stiffness matrix elements can be supplied. In this paper, a simple one-point collocation rule is used to retain similarity with SPH, leading to a non-conservative method. Several examples document how MLSPH renders dramatic improvements due to the linear consistency of its gradients on three canonical difficulties of the SPH method: spurious boundary effects, erroneous rates of strain and rotation and tension instability. Two of these examples are non-linear Lagrangian patch tests with analytic solutions with which MLSPH agrees almost exactly. The examples also show that MLSPH is not absolutely stable if the problems are run to very long times. A linear stability analysis explains both why it is more stable than SPH and not yet absolutely stable and an argument is made that for realistic dynamic problems MLSPH is stable enough. The notion of coherent particles, for which the numerical stability is identical to the physical stability, is introduced. The new method is easily retrofitted into a generic SPH code and some observations on performance are made. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Soil erosion is a common process studied by soil science, environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, coastal engineering, and many other fields. In the areas of hydraulic engineering, the geotechnics of soil erosion remains a high priority topic as the bridge scour is a common cause of bridge failures. Accurate predictions of scour depth and soil erosion rate remain challenging, due to the limitations of existing scaled experimental approach in fulfilling the hydrological and hydrodynamic similarity requirements. Computational model offers a promising alternative to further the microscale understanding of soil erosion which can help to develop engineering tools in practice. Computational model that couples Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Discrete Element Method (DEM) to simulate the behaviors of fluid-solid systems is promising to advance the current tools for soil erosion analyses. Different mathematical forms for laminar fluid flows exist for the coupled CFD-DEM model as documented in published literatures and implemented in commercial and open-source software; each of them is based on certain physics assumptions and corresponding mathematical treatments. There are, however, no direct comparison of the results of CFD-DEM models based on these seemingly different mathematical formulations, which would help researchers to select the proper simulation tool. This study implemented coupled CFD-DEM models based on three most common types of mathematical formats used in the previous modeling work. The results of different CFD-DEM models are firstly validated by comparing the results of simulating the free settling of a particle in fluid. A case study is then designed to compare the models in simulating the surface erosion of cohesionless soil inside a pipe flow using laminar flow equations. Comparison indicates that for a relatively sparse particle-fluid system, the difference of the three models is negligible. For a dense particle-fluid system, simulation with the three different mathematical formats can predict different results (as large as 10\% in the fluid velocity and 20\% in the particle drag force for the simulation case study analyzed). The results of this case study indicate that the three CFD-DEM models achieved comparable results for simulating soil erosion from an engineering perspective, however, the differences between these models, which originate from their underlying physics assumptions, must be kept in mind in selecting an appropriate simulation model as well as in comparing the results from different models.},

In particular, it focuses on the fundamental principles that govern the volume change, shear strength, yield stress, water retention and hydro-mechanical coupling.

	abstract = {Deformation and localization analysis is a crucial issue and has thus been intensively investigated in the last decades. However, in contrast to solid mechanical problems, geotechnical applications do not only concern a single solid material, the soil, but they also affect the pore-fluids, water and air, and, consequently, the coupling of the solid deformation with the pore-fluid flow. As a result, both the deformation and the localization analysis must be applied to a triphasic material consisting of the soil skeleton, the pore-water and the pore-gas, which, in geotechnical engineering, is known as unsaturated or partially saturated soil. Based on a continuum mechanical approach, unsaturated soil can be described within the well-founded framework of the Theory of Porous Media (TPM), thus including saturated soil (solid matrix and pore-water) as well as empty soil (solid matrix and pore-gas) as special cases. It is the goal of the present contribution to investigate the deformation and the localization behavior of unsaturated soil and to exhibit the influence of the solid–fluid coupling on the localization analysis. In the framework of a triphasic formulation, unsaturated soil is considered as a materially incompressible elasto-plastic or elasto-viscoplastic skeleton saturated by two viscous pore-fluids, a materially incompressible pore-liquid and a materially compressible pore-gas. Assuming quasi-static situations, the numerical computations proceed from weak formulations of the momentum balance of the overall triphasic material together with the mass balance equations of the pore-fluids and Darcy-like relations for the seepage velocities. As a result, a system of strongly coupled differential-algebraic equations (DAE) occurs, which is solved by use of the FE tool PANDAS. In particular, various initial boundary-value problems are treated on the basis of time- and space-adaptive methods, thus demonstrating the efficiency of the overall formulation. Furthermore, the influence of the pore-gas constituent on the material behavior of partially saturated soil is studied with respect to fluid-flow simulations or embankment and slope failure problems.},

This paper discusses the role of the degree of capillary saturation (S′) in modelling the coupled hydro-mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils and proposes a new constitutive model for unsaturated soils by using the degree of capillary saturation (S′) and the effective inter-particle stress (σij′). An enhanced hydraulic model is introduced to describe the hydraulic hysteresis and hydro-mechanical interaction in terms of the degree of capillary saturation (S′). In the proposed constitutive model, the shear strength, yield stress and deformation behaviour of unsaturated soils are governed directly by the above two constitutive variables, namely σij′ and S′. To be in line with the existing finite element frameworks for unsaturated soils, the proposed model is eventually generalised to constitutive functions consisting of only primary variables such as the net stress (σij), suction (s) and degree of saturation (S). The typical performance of the model for simulating the characteristic trends of unsaturated soil behaviour is discussed in several different scenarios. The model is then validated against a variety of experimental data in the literature, and the results show that a reasonable agreement can be obtained using this new constitutive model.},

In the program, similar to the works by Uzuoka et al. (2009) and Oka et al. (2010b), the FE–FD formulation in saturated condition of soil–water coupling problem, proposed by Oka et al. (1994), has been extended to unsaturated condition in soil–water–air fully coupling scheme, taking the saturation as a state variable. In order to verify the availability of the proposed numerical method, triaxial tests on unsaturated silty clay under fully undrained and unvented conditions, conducted by Oka et al. (2010a), are firstly simulated by the proposed method. The development of pore air pressure and pore water pressure measured in the specimen can be reproduced well by the proposed method. Furthermore, model tests on slope failure in unsaturated Shirasu, carried out by Kitamura et al. (2007), are also simulated by the same numerical method. From the simulation it is known that the slope failure behavior of the model ground observed in the tests can be described, on the whole, with satisfactory accuracy},

The paper then discusses the key issues in unsaturated soil modelling and how these issues can be incorporated into an existing model for saturated soils. These key issues include (1) volumetric behaviour associated with saturation or suction changes; (2) strength behaviour associated with saturation and suction changes, and (3) hydraulic behaviour associated with saturation or suction changes. The paper also shows how hysteresis in soil–water characteristics can be incorporated into the elasto-plastic framework, leading to coupled hydro-mechanical models.

	abstract = {This paper presents an enhanced version of the elasto-plastic model for partially saturated soil first proposed by Bolzon, Schrefler and Zienkiewicz in 1996, “BSZ” model, which uses the effective stress tensor and suction as independent stress variables. It is recalled that the effective stress tensor proposed by Lewis and Schrefler in 1982 is thermodynamically consistent and, compared with other choices of stress tensors, results particularly suitable for partially saturated soil mechanics. A hydraulic constitutive relationship and a hydraulic hysteresis are introduced in the model, to take into account the irreversible deformation during cyclic drying and wetting until structural collapse. For this reason the plastic rate of strain is split into the sum of two components: one depending on the effective stress tensor and the other one on suction. This is the new feature of the BSZ model. This enhanced model is then cast into a thermodynamical framework at macroscopic level and it is shown that it is possible to derive the constitutive law from the Helmholtz free energy and a dissipation function, both for associative and non- associative plasticity. Finally the model predictions have been compared with experimental data for Sion slime, with particular emphasis on the deviatoric part, and model predictions of hysteretic behaviour have been investigated in case of a wetting and drying cycle on compacted betonite–kaolin.},

The governing equations for unsaturated soils modelled as deforming porous media with immiscible porous water and air are re-formulated.. The passive air assumption is then introduced to result in a simplified form of the governing equations for unsaturated soils. The finite element method is applied to discretize the governing equations in space. The Alonso constitutive model to simulate the non-linear mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils is integrated into the present numerical model. With introduction of the natural coordinate system in the stress space a backward-Euler integration algorithm and a consistent elastoplastic tangent modulus matrix for the non-smooth multisurface pressure dependent plasticity are derived for the model.

A bonding factor has been used to represent the magnitude of the equivalent bonding stress, defined as the bonding force per unit cross-sectional area. The average skeleton stress is employed to represent the effect of average fluid pressures within soil pores. Based on an empirical relationship between the bonding factor ζ and the ratio e/es (where e and es are void ratios at unsaturated and saturated states, respectively, at the same average skeleton stress), we propose an elasto-plastic constitutive model for isotropic stress states, and then extend this model to triaxial stress states within the framework of critical state soil mechanics. Because only one yield surface is needed in the proposed model, a relatively small number of parameters are required. Comparisons between experimental data and model results show that, in most cases, the proposed model can reasonably capture the important features of unsaturated soil behavior.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the principles underlying water dynamics in the unsaturated zone and gives an overview of simulation modelling of soil water flow in the unsaturated zone. The basic relations describing kinetics of flow and governing equations of flow in the unsaturated zone are presented in a general form considering unsteady multidimensional anisotropic and nonhomogeneous flow in the presence of sinks/sources. The influence of overburden potential, characterizing swelling soils, on water transport through the unsaturated zone is discussed. Outlines of thermally-induced water flow are presented with an extension to the specific case of frozen soils. Complex relationships describing the hydrological system are reduced into the one-dimensional vertical flow cases, for which the mathematical models are defined. The entire model has the form of a set of partial differential equations together with auxiliary conditions, that describe the system's geometry, parameters, boundary conditions and in case of transient flow also the initial conditions. Simulation is defined as operation with such a mathematical model. Numerical approximations to solve governing equations of unsaturated water flow are emphasized. Recently-introduced numerical methods are discussed pointing out their advantages and limitations. Atmospheric boundary conditions of the modelled system are described with a maximizing procedure of the flux through the soil-air interface. Several options to define lower boundary conditions are discussed and a special type of lower boundary condition is given for the case that unsaturated flow is coupled with a regional groundwater model. Simulation models require data concerning input, calibration and verification. The current status of collecting model parameters is discussed as well as measurement of common verification data, i.e. phreatic surface, matric head, water content and actual evapotranspiration. Preferential flow of water through unsaturated soil has considerable consequences for simulating the field water balance. The attempts to simulate such hydrological systems are also evaluated. Some transient flow problems are affected by hysteresis. Successful attempts to build hysteresis into dynamic simulation models are still scarce, though recently a number of solutions have been presented. Finally, several practical examples of simulation of flow problems are presented. These examples are taken from everyday water management practice and document the wide range of applicability of simulation models.},

However, most existing SPH simulations of granular flows suffer from significant stress oscillation during the post-failure process, despite the use of an artificial viscosity to damp out stress fluctuation. In this paper, a new SPH approach combining viscous damping with stress/strain regularisation is proposed for simulations of granular flows. It is shown that the proposed SPH algorithm can improve the overall accuracy of the SPH performance by accurately predicting the smooth stress distribution during the post-failure process. It can also effectively remove the stress oscillation issue in the standard SPH model without having to use the standard SPH artificial viscosity that requires unphysical parameters. The predictions by the proposed SPH approach show very good agreement with experimental and numerical results reported in the literature. This suggests that the proposed method could be considered as a promising continuum alternative for simulations of granular flows.},

These formulations lead naturally to convex mathematical programs that can be solved using standard and readily available tools. In contrast to traditional discrete element analysis, the present granular contact dynamics formulation uses an implicit time discretization, thus allowing for large time steps. Moreover, in the limit of an infinite time step, the general dynamic formulation reduces to a static formulation that is useful in simulating common quasi-static problems such as triaxial tests and similar laboratory experiments. A significant portion of the paper is dedicated to exploring the consequences of the associated frictional sliding rule implied by the variational formulation adopted. In this connection, a new interior-point algorithm for general linear complementarity problems is developed and it is concluded that the associated sliding rule, in the context of granular contact dynamics, may be viewed as an artifact of the time discretization and that the use of an associated flow rule at the particle scale level generally is physically acceptable.},

	abstract = {Simulation of large deformation and post-failure of geomaterial in the framework of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) are presented in this study. The Drucker–Prager model with associated and non-associated plastic flow rules is implemented into the SPH code to describe elastic–plastic soil behavior. In contrast to previous work on SPH for solids, where the hydrostatic pressure is often estimated from density by an equation of state, this study proposes to calculate the hydrostatic pressure of soil directly from constitutive models. Results obtained in this paper show that the original SPH method, which has been successfully applied to a vast range of problems, is unable to directly solve elastic–plastic flows of soil because of the so-called SPH tensile instability. This numerical instability may result in unrealistic fracture and particles clustering in SPH simulation. For non-cohesive soil, the instability is not serious and can be completely removed by using a tension cracking treatment from soil constitutive model and thereby give realistic soil behavior. However, the serious tensile instability that is found in SPH application for cohesive soil requires a special treatment to overcome this problem. In this paper, an artificial stress method is applied to remove the SPH numerical instability in cohesive soil. A number of numerical tests are carried out to check the capability of SPH in the current application. Numerical results are then compared with experimental and finite element method solutions. The good agreement obtained from these comparisons suggests that SPH can be extended to general geotechnical problems. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In order to bridge the micro- and macro-scales, the concept of Representative Elementary Volume (REV) is applied, in which the average REV stress and the consistent tangent operators are obtained in each macroscopic integration point as the results of DEM’s simulation. In this way, the numerical constitutive law is determined through the detailed modelling of the microstructure, taking into account the nature of granular materials.

The effect of gravity (thus the local pressure) and the often-neglected contact stiffness are the focus of this study. A series of particle simulations are performed on a weakly frictional granular assembly in a split-bottom geometry considering various magnitudes of gravity and contact stiffnesses. While traditionally the inertial number, i.e., the ratio of stress to strain-rate time scales, is used to describe the flow rheology, we report that a second dimensionless number, the ratio of softness and stress time scales, must also be included to characterize the bulk flow behavior. For slow, quasistatic flows, the density increases while the effective (macroscopic) friction decreases with increase in either particle softness or local pressure. This trend is added to the mu(I) rheology and can be traced back to the anisotropy in the contact network, displaying a linear correlation between the effective friction coefficient and deviatoric fabric in the steady state. When the external rotation rate is increased towards the inertial regime, for a given gravity field and contact stiffness, the effective friction increases faster than linearly with the deviatoric fabric.},

The numerical solution, attained by Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and a variation of Discrete Element Method (DEM), the Distributed Contact Discrete Element Method (DCDEM) discretization, is achieved by directly considering solid–solid and solid–fluid interactions. The novelty of the work is centred on the generalization of the coupling of the DEM and SPH methodologies for resolved simulations, allowing for state-of-the-art contact mechanics theories to be used in arbitrary geometries, while fluid to solid and vice versa momentum transfers are accurately described. The methods are introduced, analysed and discussed. Initial validations on the DCDEM and the fluid coupling are presented, drawing from test cases in the literature. An experimental campaign serves as a validation point for complex, large scale solid–fluid flows, where a set of blocks in several configurations is subjected to a dam-break wave. Blocks are tracked and positions are then compared between experimental data and the numerical solutions. A Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique allows for the quantification of the flow field and direct comparison with numerical data. The results show that the model is accurate and is capable of treating highly complex interactions, such as transport of debris or hydrodynamic actions on structures, if relevant scales are reproduced.},

In SPH simulations, fluids are represented by sets of particles that are used as discretization points to solve the Navier–Stokes fluid dynamics equations. In the multiphase multicomponent SPH model, a modified van der Waals equation of state is used to close the system of flow equations. The combination of the momentum conservation equation with the van der Waals equation of state results in a particle equation of motion in which the total force acting on each particle consists of many-body repulsive and viscous forces, two-body (particle–particle) attractive forces, and body forces such as gravitational forces. Similar to molecular dynamics, for a given fluid component the combination of repulsive and attractive forces causes phase separation. The surface tension at liquid–liquid interfaces is imposed through component dependent attractive forces. The wetting behavior of the fluids is controlled by phase dependent attractive interactions between the fluid particles and stationary particles that represent the solid phase. The dynamics of fluids away from the interface is governed by purely hydrodynamic forces. Comparison with analytical solutions for static conditions and relatively simple flows demonstrates the accuracy of the SPH model.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a computational framework based on the mesh-free smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is developed to study the coupled behaviour of fluid and solid in a deformable porous medium. The mathematical framework developed herein is derived from the Biot's two-phase mixture theory in which the solid is modelled as an elasto-plastic material and the pore-fluid as an incompressible fluid. The key feature of the proposed numerical framework is that both solid and fluid phases are solved simultaneously in two different Lagrangian discretisations (or two different sets of Lagrangian particles) using their own governing equations that are linked through several laws of physics. The capability of the SPH method to model large deformation of the solid materials enables the framework to account for the permeability change due to the dilatant shear behaviour of the solid phase. To obtain a stable and accurate SPH solution for the pore-fluid, an incompressible SPH (ISPH) approach is adapted to correctly simulate the pore-pressure distribution of the fluid phase inside the porous medium. The proposed coupled SPH framework is firstly validated against analytical and solutions obtained using finite element method (FEM) for a submerged soil medium subjected to a gravitational load and a seepage flow through an elastic embankment, respectively. Then, it is employed for the simulation of flows through rockfill dams and an embankment failure induced by seepage flows. Simulation results predicted by SPH show very good agreements with analytical, FEM and experimental results. This suggests that the proposed two-phase SPH framework is a promising approach for future studies of coupled problems that involve complex water free-surface/seepage flows and large deformation of soils which are difficult to be modelled using traditional FEM-based coupled two-phase flow models.},

Dry soil is modeled by one-phase flow while saturated soil is modeled by separate water and soil phases. Interaction between soil and water is taken into account by means of pore water pressure and seepage force. Simulation tests of soil excavation by a water jet are calculated as a challenging example to verify the broad applicability of the SPH method.

	abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a meshfree, Lagrangian particle method which has advantages in handling solids with extremely large deformation. Like any other numerical methods, cares must be taken to ensure its desirable accuracy and stability through considering several correction techniques in calculation. The selection of values for parameters in those correction approaches is a key step in SPH simulation, which is always difficult for new beginners to deal well with effectively. This paper examines the common inconsistency and instability problems in SPH method and studies its computational efficiency when applied to hydrodynamics problems with material strength like soil column collapse. We analyzed in detail how the correction techniques mitigate these inconsistency and instability problems. Also, the numerical testing results associate with different values for the parameters used in the correction techniques are provided for better understanding the influence of these parameters and for finding out the desirable values. It is found that (1) the SPH method is easily subjected to an inconsistency problem in the boundary area due to the boundary deficiency, and it can be treated well by adopting “virtual particles” contributing to the particle summations. (2) The numerical oscillation in SPH simulation can be mitigated effectively by artificial viscosity with the suggested parameter values. (3) The tension cracking treatment, artificial viscosity and artificial stress work well in removing the tensile instability problem in SPH method. In addition, the nearest neighboring particle searching (NNPS) algorithm, spacing ratio, smoothing length and time step influence the efficiency and accuracy of SPH method significantly. It is shown that SPH method with suggested parameters values can produce a very good result compared with the experimental result.},

	abstract = {An elastic-viscoplastic model (Ulrich, 2013) is combined to a multi-phase SPH formulation (Hu and Adams, 2006; Ghaitanellis et al., 2015) to model granular flows and non-cohesive sediment transport. The soil is treated as a continuum exhibiting a viscoplastic behaviour. Thus, below a critical shear stress (i.e. the yield stress), the soil is assumed to behave as an isotropic linear-elastic solid. When the yield stress is exceeded, the soil flows and behaves as a shear-thinning fluid. A liquid-solid transition threshold based on the granular material properties is proposed, so as to make the model free of numerical parameter. The yield stress is obtained from Drucker–Prager criterion that requires an accurate computation of the effective stress in the soil. A novel method is proposed to compute the effective stress in SPH, solving a Laplace equation. The model is applied to a two-dimensional soil collapse (Bui et al., 2008) and a dam break over mobile beds (Spinewine and Zech, 2007). Results are compared with experimental data and a good agreement is obtained.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a model which can be used for fast landslides where coupling between solid and pore fluid plays a fundamental role. The proposed model is able to describe debris flows where the difference of velocities between solid grains and fluid is important. The approach is based on the mathematical model proposed by Zienkiewicz and Shiomi, which is similar to those of Pitman and Le and Pudasaini. The novelty of the present work is the numerical technique used, the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We propose to use a double set of nodes for soil and water phases, the interaction between them being described by a suitable drag law. The paper presents both mathematical and numerical models, describing the main assumptions and their limitations. Then, the model is applied to (1) a simple case where shocks and expansion waves appear, (2) a dam break problem on a horizontal plane with a frictional soil phase, and (3) a debris flow which happened in Hong Kong. The main conclusions that can be drawn from the applications are: Debris flows having 2 phases with important relative mobility present a rich structure of shocks and rarefaction waves, which has to be properly modeled. Otherwise, the model will have numerical damping or dispersion. Dambreak exercises provide interesting information in simple and controlled situations. We can see how both phases move relative to each other. Real debris flows can be simulated with the proposed model, obtaining reasonable results.},

	abstract = {Extreme weather events, such as floods, are becoming more frequent in future with all consequences concerning the safety especially of water retaining structures, in particular, levees used as technical flood protection. The knowledge and correct consideration of coupled hydro-mechanical processes influencing the failure and post-failure behaviour of water saturated soils are of paramount significance for the assessment of hydraulically loaded geotechnical structures. This study focuses on the modelling of the processes governing the behaviour of water saturated soils using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) on the example of a homogeneous embankment under different loading conditions. This paper aims to improve available SPH framework in order to enhance soil-water interaction in this method for geotechnical engineering investigations. To achieve this goal, the suggested approach is validated intensively by various well-known problems. Finally, the verified tool is used to investigate the hydro-mechanical behaviour of homogeneous embankments under simultaneous hydraulic and mechanical loading. The simulation results prove that the suggested approach is capable of simulating relevant hydraulic and mechanical processes governing the deformation behaviour of hydraulically loaded structures beyond the failure point allowing the detailed analysis of the post-failure behaviour characterised by large deformations.},

For this purpose sets of numerical calculations (2D and 3D) of the fundamental problem of the collapse of initially vertical cylinders of granular materials are performed. The results of modeling of columns with different aspect ratios and different angles of internal friction are presented. The numerical outcomes are assessed not only with respect to the reference experimental data but also with respect to other numerical methods, namely the Distinct Element Method and the Finite Element Method. In order to improve the numerical efficiency of the method, the Graphics Processing Units implementation is presented and some related issues are discussed. It is believed that this study corresponds to a new application of SPH approaches for simulations of granular media and results reveal the interest of this method to capture fine details of processes of such complex problems as waves–seabed interactions.},

The tire-soil interaction algorithm is implemented in Pam-Crash software package to capture node-symmetric node-to-segment contact with edge treatment. The rolling resistance coefficient is computed from simulations and then validated against physical measurements. The rolling resistance coefficient is calculated for different terrains, such as dry sand, dense sand, clayey soil and hard surface. In addition, the rolling resistance is also computed for various tire inflation pressures and applied vertical loads.

	abstract = {This work illustrated an application of the FOSS code SPHERA v.8.0 (RSE SpA, Milano, Italy) to the simulation of landslide hazard at the slope of a water basin. SPHERA is based on the weakly compressible SPH method (WCSPH) and holds a mixture model, consistent with the packing limit of the Kinetic Theory of Granular Flow (KTGF), which was previously tested for simulating two-phase free-surface rapid flows involving water-sediment interaction. In this study a limiting viscosity parameter was implemented in the previous formulation of the mixture model to limit the growth of the apparent viscosity, thus saving computational time while preserving the solution accuracy. This approach is consistent with the experimental behavior of high polymer solutions for which an almost constant value of viscosity may be approached at very low deformation rates near the transition zone of elastic\&ndash;plastic regime. In this application, the limiting viscosity was used as a numerical parameter for optimization of the computation. Some preliminary tests were performed by simulating a 2D erosional dam break, proving that a proper selection of the limiting viscosity leads to a considerable drop of the computational time without altering significantly the numerical solution. SPHERA was then validated by simulating a 2D scale experiment reproducing the early phase of the Vajont landslide when a tsunami wave was generated that climbed the opposite mountain side with a maximum run-up of about 270 m. The obtained maximum run-up was very close to the experimental result. Influence of saturation of the landslide material below the still water level was also accounted, showing that the landslide dynamics can be better represented and the wave run-up can be properly estimated.},

	abstract = {A SPH model based on a general formulation for solid–fluid two-phase flows is proposed for suspended sediment motion in free surface flows. The water and the sediment are treated as two miscible fluids, and the multi-fluid system is discretized by a single set of SPH particles, which move with the water velocity and carry properties of the two phases. Large eddy simulation (LES) is introduced to deal with the turbulence effect, and the widely used Smagorinsky model is modified to take into account the influence of sediment particles on the turbulence. The drag force is accurately formulated by including the hindered settling effect. In the model, the water is assumed to be weakly compressible while the sediment is incompressible, and a new equation of state is proposed for the pressure in the sediment–water mixture. Dynamic boundary condition is employed to treat wall boundaries, and a new strategy of Shepard filtering is adopted to damp the pressure oscillation. The developed two-phase SPH model is validated by comparing the numerical results with analytical solutions for idealized cases of still water containing both neutrally buoyant and naturally settling sand and for plane Poiseuille flows carrying neutrally buoyant particles, and is then applied to sand dumping from a line source into a water tank, where the sand cloud settles with a response of the free water surface. It is shown that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data as well as the empirical formulas. The characteristics of the settling sand cloud, the pressure field, and the flow vortices are studied. The motion of the free water surface is also discussed. The proposed two-phase SPH model is proven to be effective for numerical simulation of sand dumping into waters.},
