abstract = {This paper describes a floating-frame-of-reference-based (FFRF-based) recursive formulation for flexible bodies. A new definition of the joint coordinate system is introduced that makes it simpler to formulate more concise velocity transformation matrices. A path matrix, which defines the connectivity of the mechanism for the open loop system, simplifies introducing the topology of the rigid and/or flexible spanning tree. The flexible multibody system is often subjected to large reference motion but small deformations. Both Euler–Bernoulli-based beam (EBB) and continuum-mechanics-based beam (CMB) elements are implemented to validate the proposed approach. The reference conditions mentioned here are used to eliminate the rigid body motion from the deformation field, i.e., removal of the coordinate redundancy, in the FFRF. Thus, different reference conditions, such as simply supported, single-cantilever, and double-cantilever are used. Finally, it is demonstrated that the proposed approach is not limited by the choice of reference conditions, which helps the modeler to apply the approach to different multibody applications. In the numerical analysis, the results of the total energy variation and constraint violations of the close loop systems are fulfilled with good accuracy by using both penalty formulation with augmented Lagrangian method and coordinate partitioning approach for constraint stabilization. Furthermore, the proposed semi-recursive method produces dynamic analysis results comparable to the ANCF with better computational efficiency. In the end, compared to fully recursive approach, the proposed semi-recursive approach shows better efficiency and easier implementation.}

System analysis and optimization of technical products are increasingly supported by virtual prototypes. For the modeling of the dynamical behavior of mechanical subsystems, elastic multibody systems are frequently used. In this contribution, an overview of the basic approaches to model elastic multibody systems with the help of the floating frame of reference formulation is given. It is one of the most common approaches in the field of modeling flexible multibody systems. Here, the discretization of the elastic bodies, e.g. with the help of the Finite Element Method, introduces a large number of elastic degrees of freedom and an efficient simulation of the system becomes difficult. A focus in this work is the linear model order reduction of the elastic degrees of freedom, which is a key step for using flexible bodies in elastic multibody systems. Thereby, the simulation of the elastic multibody system becomes possible or more efficient from a computational point of view. Recently a variety of modern reduction techniques, based on Krylov subspaces or based on a singular value decomposition have been developed and applied successfully in engineering applications. The topic of this work is the application of this techniques in elastic multibody systems with its special requirements, such as, e.g., structure preservation. The differences of these reduction methods are introduced and compared.}

Durafly 3648 Brushless DC motor of UAV is modelled with the Finite Element Analysis software. Then it is simulated with Ansys-Rmxprt according to pulse degree, speed and battery voltage of the UAV. The training times and Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) of the Artificial Intelligence Techniques (AITs) are calculated for motor input power estimation. The best result among the implemented AITs is achieved with the MAPE of 0.269% by the SVM model. Then the graphical user interface (GUI) is developed to easily obtain information about how efficient the battery can be used, and the flight time of UAVs. Thanks to the proposed GUI software, the input power of the motor can be estimated via input parameters without the long-time consuming simulations.}

The work presented in this paper deals with the mechatronic approach for the design of a magnetostrictive actuator with flexure amplifier and a magnetically biased magnetostrictive actuator for application in high frequency flapper–nozzle servo valve. A magnetostrictive actuator has been designed, built and integrated into an existing flapper–nozzle servo valve by replacing the torque motor. Incorporating the dynamics of the magnetostrictive actuator, the dynamics of the valve was simulated. Necessary parameters for the actuator have been arrived by finite element model. No load flow characteristics are analyzed and compared with experimental values. Step response has been compared with conventional valve. The results show that the valve has satisfactory static and dynamic characteristics for applications in high-speed actuation systems.}

ABSTRACT = {The design of modern industrial products is further improved through the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation. Realistic simulation is enabled by the closed loop between the hardware under test (HUT) and real-time simulation. Such a system involves a field programmable gate array (FPGA) and digital signal processor (DSP). An HIL model can bypass serious damage to the real object, reduce debugging cost, and, finally, reduce the comprehensive effort during the testing. This paper provides a historical overview of HIL simulations through different engineering challenges, i.e., within automotive, power electronics systems, and different industrial drives. Various platforms, such as National Instruments, dSPACE, Typhoon HIL, or MATLAB Simulink Real-Time toolboxes and Speedgoat hardware systems, offer a powerful tool for efficient and successful investigations in different fields. Therefore, HIL simulation practice must begin already during the university&rsquo;s education process to prepare the students for professional engagements in the industry, which was also verified experimentally at the end of the paper.},

abstract = {One of the most challenging and risky operations for spacecraft is to perform rendezvous and docking autonomously in space. To ensure a safe and reliable operation, such a mission must be carefully designed and thoroughly verified before a real space mission can be launched. This paper describes the control strategy for achieving high fidelity contact dynamics simulation of a new, robotics-based, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) rendezvous and docking simulation facility that uses two industrial robots to physically simulate the 6-DOF dynamic maneuvering of two docking satellites. The facility is capable of physically simulating the final approaching within a 25-meter range and the entire docking/capturing process for a satellite on-orbit servicing mission. The key difficulties of using industrial robots for high-fidelity HIL contact dynamics simulation were found and different solution techniques were investigated in the presented project. An admittance control method was proposed to achieve the goal of making the robots in the HIL simulation process match the impedance of the two docking satellites. Simulation study showed the effectiveness and performance of the proposed solution method.}},
