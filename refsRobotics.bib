  abstract = {A wheel loader is an earth-moving machine used in construction sites, gravel pits and mining to move blasted rock, soil and gravel. In the presence of a nearby dump truck, the wheel loader is said to be operating in a short loading cycle. This paper concerns the moving of material (soil, gravel and fragmented rock) by a wheel loader in a short loading cycle with more emphasis on the loading step. Due to the complexity of bucket-environment interactions, even three decades of research efforts towards automation of the bucket loading operation have not yet resulted in any fully autonomous system. This paper highlights the key challenges in automation and tele-remote operation of earth-moving machines and provides a survey of different areas of research within the scope of the earth-moving operation. The survey of publications presented in this paper is conducted with an aim to highlight the previous and ongoing research work in this field with an effort to strike a balance between recent and older publications. Another goal of the survey is to identify the research areas in which knowledge essential to automate the earth moving process is lagging behind. The paper concludes by identifying the knowledge gaps to give direction to future research in this field.}

  abstract = {Abstract Distributed as an open-source library since 2013, real-time appearance-based mapping (RTAB-Map) started as an appearance-based loop closure detection approach with memory management to deal with large-scale and long-term online operation. It then grew to implement simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of constraints on sensors, processing capabilities, and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power, and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual- or lidar-based, comparison is difficult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB-Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with different robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of RTAB-Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real-world datasets (e.g., KITTI, EuRoC, TUM RGB-D, MIT Stata Center on PR2 robot), outlining strengths, and limitations of visual and lidar SLAM configurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.},

  abstract = {When designing and planning an autonomous, adaptive system utilizing the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI), both the specific field of AI and the desired use case must be addressed to achieve a reliable system. In the field of autonomous robotics, the authors focus on the aspect of training a robot not in reality, where training is reliant on real-time and the amount of hardware systems performing the training, but in a virtual environment, which can be parallelized and customized individually. In this paper, a functional simulation of a real robot was developed and trained using reinforcement learning in a virtual environment to successfully complete a specified task. The trained model was then transferred to the physical robot, which itself was able to complete the specified task in the real world, without the need of previous real-world training. Due to extensive observation and analysis of the physical system’s characteristics, the presented direct transfer approach does not rely on domain randomization, which is usually applied in this field.}

  abstract = {This paper describes a floating-frame-of-reference-based (FFRF-based) recursive formulation for flexible bodies. A new definition of the joint coordinate system is introduced that makes it simpler to formulate more concise velocity transformation matrices. A path matrix, which defines the connectivity of the mechanism for the open loop system, simplifies introducing the topology of the rigid and/or flexible spanning tree. The flexible multibody system is often subjected to large reference motion but small deformations. Both Euler–Bernoulli-based beam (EBB) and continuum-mechanics-based beam (CMB) elements are implemented to validate the proposed approach. The reference conditions mentioned here are used to eliminate the rigid body motion from the deformation field, i.e., removal of the coordinate redundancy, in the FFRF. Thus, different reference conditions, such as simply supported, single-cantilever, and double-cantilever are used. Finally, it is demonstrated that the proposed approach is not limited by the choice of reference conditions, which helps the modeler to apply the approach to different multibody applications. In the numerical analysis, the results of the total energy variation and constraint violations of the close loop systems are fulfilled with good accuracy by using both penalty formulation with augmented Lagrangian method and coordinate partitioning approach for constraint stabilization. Furthermore, the proposed semi-recursive method produces dynamic analysis results comparable to the ANCF with better computational efficiency. In the end, compared to fully recursive approach, the proposed semi-recursive approach shows better efficiency and easier implementation.}

  abstract = {Abstract
              System analysis and optimization of technical products are increasingly supported by virtual prototypes. For the modeling of the dynamical behavior of mechanical subsystems, elastic multibody systems are frequently used. In this contribution, an overview of the basic approaches to model elastic multibody systems with the help of the floating frame of reference formulation is given. It is one of the most common approaches in the field of modeling flexible multibody systems. Here, the discretization of the elastic bodies, e.g. with the help of the Finite Element Method, introduces a large number of elastic degrees of freedom and an efficient simulation of the system becomes difficult. A focus in this work is the linear model order reduction of the elastic degrees of freedom, which is a key step for using flexible bodies in elastic multibody systems. Thereby, the simulation of the elastic multibody system becomes possible or more efficient from a computational point of view. Recently a variety of modern reduction techniques, based on Krylov subspaces or based on a singular value decomposition have been developed and applied successfully in engineering applications. The topic of this work is the application of this techniques in elastic multibody systems with its special requirements, such as, e.g., structure preservation. The differences of these reduction methods are introduced and compared.}

Durafly 3648 Brushless DC motor of UAV is modelled with the Finite Element Analysis software. Then it is simulated with Ansys-Rmxprt according to pulse degree, speed and battery voltage of the UAV. The training times and Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) of the Artificial Intelligence Techniques (AITs) are calculated for motor input power estimation. The best result among the implemented AITs is achieved with the MAPE of 0.269% by the SVM model. Then the graphical user interface (GUI) is developed to easily obtain information about how efficient the battery can be used, and the flight time of UAVs. Thanks to the proposed GUI software, the input power of the motor can be estimated via input parameters without the long-time consuming simulations.}

As their bandwidths are limited, they are not suitable for high-speed applications. The work presented in this paper deals with the mechatronic approach for the design of a magnetostrictive actuator with flexure amplifier and a magnetically biased magnetostrictive actuator for application in high frequency flapper–nozzle servo valve. A magnetostrictive actuator has been designed, built and integrated into an existing flapper–nozzle servo valve by replacing the torque motor. Incorporating the dynamics of the magnetostrictive actuator, the dynamics of the valve was simulated. Necessary parameters for the actuator have been arrived by finite element model. No load flow characteristics are analyzed and compared with experimental values. Step response has been compared with conventional valve. The results show that the valve has satisfactory static and dynamic characteristics for applications in high-speed actuation systems.}

  abstract = {One of the most challenging and risky operations for spacecraft is to perform rendezvous and docking autonomously in space. To ensure a safe and reliable operation, such a mission must be carefully designed and thoroughly verified before a real space mission can be launched. This paper describes the control strategy for achieving high fidelity contact dynamics simulation of a new, robotics-based, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) rendezvous and docking simulation facility that uses two industrial robots to physically simulate the 6-DOF dynamic maneuvering of two docking satellites. The facility is capable of physically simulating the final approaching within a 25-meter range and the entire docking/capturing process for a satellite on-orbit servicing mission. The key difficulties of using industrial robots for high-fidelity HIL contact dynamics simulation were found and different solution techniques were investigated in the presented project. An admittance control method was proposed to achieve the goal of making the robots in the HIL simulation process match the impedance of the two docking satellites. Simulation study showed the effectiveness and performance of the proposed solution method.}

  abstract = {Summary This paper addresses a new robust control scheme for tracking control of the robot manipulators. This algorithm employs time delay estimation (TDE) technique in combination with backstepping control strategy. The suggested control scheme has no dependency on the robot dynamic model and knowing the bound of the inertia matrix is enough to develop this controller. To develop the idea, at first the boundedness of the TDE errors is analyzed by Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach. Next, the proposed TDE based adaptive backstepping nonsingular terminal sliding mode control (ABNTSMC) algorithm is developed. In this way, a novel adaptive-robust term is employed to defeat the chattering phenomenon. Moreover, the closed-loop stability of the system is proven through Lyapunov second approach. Fast transient response, supreme robustness, and chattering-free as the premier specifications are gained employing the proposed control algorithm. The efficiency of the suggested control scheme is illustrated through some simulations on an industrial robot and the results are compared with some other control algorithms. Finally, the practical effectiveness of the proposed TDE based control algorithm is verified through some experiments on a parallelogram robot manipulator.}
